Stuff to do in Houston
---------------------

Based off the original project for SassConf, [Stuff in Austin](http://stuffinaustin.com/).

A repository of fun things to do in Houston. Viewable at [stuffinhouston.com](http://stuffinhouston.com/).

## Purpose

This is a repository of places, activities, and restaurants that are fun to do in Houston. Meant to be a useful thing for the conferences that happen in Houston to use/share/update as needed.

## Taco / BBQ Bias

Warning: There is a large bias towards tacos and BBQ here. We give no apologies for our love of tacos and BBQ.

## Contributing

There are two large ways that can contribute to this repository: content and code. We will start with content, as it will not require a full development environment to be setup— in fact you can add files right here on GitHub if you desire.

### Contribute content

There are three current collections of items that can be added to the site. Restaurants, activities, and places can be found in the three folders `_restaurants`, `_activities`, and `_places`, respectively. For each one, to add a new entry— you just need to add a file that ends with `.md` (stands for [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)). For example, if you would like to add in Zilker Park, within the `_places` directory, add a file named `zilker.md`. In each folder, there is also a file called `_template`, which has the proper meta-data at the front. Copy/paste that file into your new file, fill in the right information, and voilà! A new entry has been added.

### Contribute code

TODO: Write a TODO.
